1. MOCV5.m is used to generate the coordinates of the expansion section of a minimum-length nozzle by utilizing the method of characteristics. The aim is to import the coordinates on a CAD software of the user's choice to generate the 3D expansion section of the nozzle.
2. performance_cpc.m aims to output a datasheet summarizing the key performance parameters of the engine. Variables under "Global Parameters" can be changed as per the engine the user is trying to build.
